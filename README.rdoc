# ActiveRecord::BaseWithoutTable

Get the power of ActiveRecord models, including validation, without having a table in the database.

This is a fork of the original project by Jonathan Viney, Peter Abrahamsen, and Peter Suschlik, with modifications to make it compatible with more recent versions of Rails.
